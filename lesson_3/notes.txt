Programs
  Sequence of expressions
  assignment
    x = 3
    x = x*x
  Straight line programs
  Conditionals - branching
  Program 1
    indentation affects semantics
  Complexity theory
    how long does a program run for?
    Straight line?
    Branching?
    Consider more useful program
    Should depend on size of data input
    We require a loop
  Looping Construct
    Turing complete!
    Program 2
    For what values will this loop terminate?
      positive
      negative
      0
    decrementing loop
    How can we modify this program so taht it finds the root of arbitrary numbers?
    Concept of approximation
    find y such that y*y = x +/- epsilon
    Program 3
