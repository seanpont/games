"""
Design and analysis of algorithms -- continued.

The following problems all take a list of n random integers

ThreeSum
  Find all the triples that add to zero
  Faster ThreeSum: Can you solve it in n^2 lg(n) time?
Closest Pair
  Given an array of N floats, find the closest pair
  Can we solve it in linearithmic time (n lg (n))?
Farthest Pair
  Given an array of N floats, find two values whose difference is
  no smaller than that of any other pair.
  Goal: solve it in linear time
Birthday Attack!
